## Simple Fetch and Display Example

This project demonstrates how to **fetch JSON data** from an API and **display it** using React. The key steps include:

1. Use `fetch()` inside `useEffect` to retrieve data when the component loads.
2. Store the response in a state variable using `useState`.
3. Map over the data to dynamically render it as cards or lists.

The code is clean, efficient, and focuses on making data fetching easy to understand for beginners!
